                            The UAE’s corporate landscape has undergone a historic transformation with the introduction of Corporate Tax, formally enforced under Federal Decree-Law No. 47 of 2022 and amended by Federal Decree-Law
                            No. 60 of 2023. This landmark reform aligns the UAE with global taxation standards, strengthens economic transparency, and enhances the nation’s competitive edge in attracting foreign investment.

                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Effective from January 1, 2025, or later, the UAE is implementing the <a href="https://www.amcaauditing.com/domestic-minimum-top-up-tax-for-multinationals"> Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (DMTT) </a>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This meets the OECD's Pillar Two rules to offer a 15% effective tax rate on large multinational enterprises (MNEs).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Applies to MNEs with €750 million (approx. AED 2.99 billion) or more in consolidated global revenue, in at least 2 of the past 4 years.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This ensures the UAE does not lose tax collection if foreign jurisdictions impose a top-up, preserving the UAE's tax base.

                        <h2>Corporate Tax Audit</h2>
                        <br />
                        <p>A <a href="https://www.amcaauditing.com/why-do-corporate-tax-audits-matter"> Corporate Tax Audit </a> is an official inspection carried out by the FTA to verify whether a company has complied with Corporate Tax laws and correctly calculated and reported its tax obligations.</p>

                        <br />

                        <h3>How FTA Conducts a Tax Audit</h3>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            The FTA issues prior notice to the business, though in some cases, audits may be conducted with little warning.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The audit can cover:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Corporate tax returns</li>
                                <li>Supporting financial statements</li>
                                <li>Bank transactions</li>
                                <li>Invoices and contracts</li>
                                <li>Transfer pricing documentation</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li><b>On-site / Off-site Audits:</b> Audits may take place at the taxpayer’s premises or at the FTA’s offices.</li>
                            <li><b>Language Requirement:</b> Businesses must be able to provide documents in Arabic when requested. Failure to do so may result in penalties (AED 5,000 per instance).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />

                        <h3>Essential Criteria for FTA Audits</h3>
                        <br />
                        <p>The FTA may select businesses for audit based on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Significant discrepancies between accounting income and taxable income.</li>
                            <li>Unusually high deductions or exemptions claimed.</li>
                            <li>Frequent losses or revenue inconsistencies.</li>
                            <li>Non-compliance in VAT or Excise filings (cross-checked by FTA systems).</li>
                            <li>Random sampling as part of compliance enforcement.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />

                        <h3>Documents Required During Tax Audit</h3>
                        <br />

                        </ul>
                        <br />

                        <h3>Penalties for Non-Compliance</h3>
                        <br />
                        <p>Failure to maintain proper accounting or comply during a tax audit can lead to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>AED 10,000 fine </b> for failure to register for Corporate Tax.</li>

                        </ul>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A: The FTA imposes an AED 10,000 penalty for late registration, doubling to AED 20,000 for repeat violations within 24 months.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Q2: Can Free Zone companies still benefit from 0% tax in 2025?</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A: Yes, Free Zone companies in the UAE can continue to benefit from the 0% corporate tax rate in 2025, provided they qualify as a Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP). This status is governed by
                            Federal Decree-Law No. 47 of 2022 on Corporate Tax, specifically under Article 18, and is further detailed in Ministerial Decision No. 229 of 2025, which refines the scope of Qualifying and Excluded
                            Activities for Free Zone entities. Meet the FTA’s Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP) conditions, such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Maintaining adequate substance in the UAE</li>
                                <li>Carrying out qualifying activities</li>
                                <li>Preparing and submitting audited financial statements</li>
                                <li>Ensuring non-qualifying income does not exceed 5% of total revenue or AED 5 million (whichever is lower)</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>
                            If these criteria were not violated in the previous tax period, the company remains eligible for the 0% rate in 2025.
