                        <p>In order to determine the accuracy of the VAT liability of a taxpayer, a tax audit reviews several documents held by the taxpayer. A tax audit examines the duties of taxable entities and whether their responsibilities are being fulfilled in compliance with tax laws.</p>
                        <p>The Federal Tax Authority (FTA) is responsible for conducting the taxable entity's annual tax audit to ensure all liabilities are charged, collected, and turned over to the government within the specified timeline. As a result, the taxpayer will receive an audit notice in advance.</p>

                        <p>Noncompliance with tax laws will probably result in penalties. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has issued a set of disadvantages to those guilty of non-compliance. The following are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Non-maintenance of financial records – AED 10,000</li>
                            <li>Submission of an incorrect tax return by the Registrant – AED 3,000</li>
                            <li>Repetition of submitting false tax return – AED 5,000</li>
                            <li>Failure of the person conducting business to support the work of a Tax Auditor – AED 20,000</li>
                            <li>Failure of the taxable person to submit a registration application within the time frame specified in the tax law – AED 20,000</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These violations of tax laws can also lead to imprisonment of the authorized signatory and can be considered a criminal offense.</p>
