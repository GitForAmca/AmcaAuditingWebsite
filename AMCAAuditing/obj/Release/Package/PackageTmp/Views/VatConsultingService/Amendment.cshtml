                        <p>Since its implementation in the United Arab Emirates on 1st January 2018, VAT may be a familiar term among businessmen and entrepreneurs.  Businesses with a turnover exceeding AED 375000 per year must register with VAT.  Depending on the nature of the VAT application, the firm's details may need to be amended after registration. Within 20 days of the date of the change, these amendments must be reported to the FTA. These changes can be easily made online. Depending on what changes are made, some changes may require FTA approval, while others may not.</p>
                        <h2>Direct amendments are prohibited in specific fields</h2>
                        <p>In the following list, you will find the fields which cannot be edited directly:</p>
