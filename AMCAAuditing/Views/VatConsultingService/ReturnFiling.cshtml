                        <p>As part of the VAT system, VAT returns are required to be filed by entities to report the VAT they have collected and paid to the tax authority during a given period. During a tax period, a VAT return summarizes the supplies and purchases a taxable person made and shows their VAT liability.</p>
                        <h2>Filing of a VAT Return</h2>
                        <p>It is a legal requirement that all businesses in the United Arab Emirates comply with VAT regulations and follow all the FTA rules and regulations. Therefore, in addition to registration with the FTA on time, you must create and use a proper VAT invoice and keep appropriate records and accounts.</p>
                        <h2>Liability of VAT </h2>
                        <p>The VAT obligation is the difference between the output tax chargeable (VAT on supplies of goods and services) and the input tax recoverable for a given taxation period. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between FTA and output tax in cases where the output tax exceeds the input tax. In contrast, if the input tax is greater than the output tax, a taxable person will be entitled to recover the excess input tax and set it off against future payments due to FTA.</p>
                        <h2>How to file a VAT return?</h2>
                        <p>The online portal made available by the Federal Tax Authority allows taxable individuals in the UAE to submit their VAT returns. Initially, the taxpayer should log into the FTA online portal using their respective username/email address and password to access Form VAT201. Afterward, a tax professional will help you complete the form and file it by the deadline set by the FTA.</p>
                        <h2>How do companies process VAT return filing in the UAE?</h2>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to VAT return filing in the UAE, companies must submit regular returns to the FTA detailing their taxable supplies and the amount of VAT charged and paid. This process can be time-consuming and confusing, especially for businesses unfamiliar with the UAE's tax laws and regulations. However, by working with a reputable auditing firm like AMCA, companies can ensure that their VAT returns are filed correctly and on time, avoiding potential penalties or fines from the FTA.
                        </p>

In addition, accurate VAT return filing can help businesses avoid overpaying or underpaying VAT, impacting their cash flow and profitability.</p>

                        <h3>When are businesses required to file VAT returns?</h3>
                        <p>The FTA requires taxable organizations to submit VAT returns within 28 days after the end of the tax period applicable to their business type. 'Tax period' refers to a specific time frame in which the taxable amount shall be determined and paid. A typical tax period is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Quarterly for companies with a turnover of less than AED 150 million</li>
                            <li>Companies with annual revenues exceeding AED 150 million are assessed monthly</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Businesses may be allocated different tax periods at the discretion of the FTA. However, if failure to file a tax return within the prescribed period, the violator will be liable for fines under Cabinet Resolution No. 40 of 2017 on Administrative Penalties for Violations of UAE Tax Laws.</p>
