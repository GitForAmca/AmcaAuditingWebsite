The FTA won't consider a request or supporting documents submitted in English.</p>

                                <strong>What is the purpose of the UAE Government introducing VAT?</strong>
                                <p>
                                    UAE generates new income from VAT. As a result, high-quality public services can continue to be provided. Additionally, it will reduce UAE's reliance on oil and hydrocarbons as a revenue source.

                                <strong>When did VAT come into effect? </strong>
                                <p>
                                    As of 1 January 2018, VAT was introduced across the UAE.

                                <strong>How is VAT collected by the government?</strong>
                                <p>
                                    Businesses are responsible for keeping careful records of their income, costs, and associated VAT charges. VAT is charged to all registered businesses and traders at the prevailing rate and is incurred on the goods and services they purchase from suppliers. Differences in these amounts are reclaimed or paid to the government.
