                        <p>It is common for businesses to de-register for VAT with the UAE Federal Tax Authority, also known as cancelation or termination of VAT registration.  Only the FTA can approve a VAT deregistration in the UAE if the reasons for termination are valid and the necessary conditions are met. Upon registering with the FTA for the first time, businesses that do not exceed AED 187,00 in their first 12 months of operation or cease making taxable supplies can deregister from the VAT case.</p>
                        <h2>VAT Deregistration</h2>
                        <p>Through the FTA portal, the VAT Deregistration procedure in UAE can be conducted online. Businesses that cease to operate, however, must obtain a letter of liquidation from the government to be deregistered from VAT. </p>
                        <p>Businesses in the UAE can deregister from paying VAT either voluntarily or mandatorily through VAT de-registration.    </p>
                        <p>As soon as the FTA receives the application for VAT deregistration in the UAE, it will verify the application, and if the requirement has been met, it will cancel the VAT number for the entity. The FTA may reject the deregistration application if the reasons or conditions are invalid.   </p>
                        <h3>Who must de-register for UAE VAT?</h3>
                        <p>If your taxable turnover is less than AED 187,500 or you have stopped conducting business, you must mandatorily deregister for VAT. In another case if the business makes taxable supplies over the past 12 months period that exceed the voluntary VAT registration threshold limit of AED 187,500 but is below the mandatory VAT registration threshold limit of AED 375,000, you may choose to deregister your business on a voluntary basis.</p>

                        <h3>What is the eligibility for VAT Deregistration?</h3>
                        <p>
                            According to FTA regulations, you can determine your eligibility for VAT Deregistration in UAE by following the steps below:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p> The FTA must be notified by submitting a VAT deregistration application when:</p>
                                <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
                                    <li>
                                        The business no longer makes taxable supplies.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The business has made taxable supplies in the past 12 consecutive months, but it is below the voluntary VAT registration threshold of AED 187,500.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Other reasons impact the ongoing business operations, and the registrant is no longer eligible for FTA registration for VAT purposes.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <p class="Mtop-10"></p>
                                <p>  It is possible for businesses that have made taxable supplies over the past 12 months to apply for VAT deregistration voluntarily if they are above the voluntary VAT registration threshold limit of AED 187,500 but below the mandatory registration threshold limit of AED 375,000.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>It is not advisable to move forward with the VAT cancellation process if you intend to continue your business or if you are trying to find an investor.</strong> As such, if the company expects to make a reasonable return within the next twelve months, keep the TRN and file the tax return as ZERO.</p>
