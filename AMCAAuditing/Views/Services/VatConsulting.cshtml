                        <p>At the beginning of 2018, the government in the UAE introduced the Value Added Tax (VAT). According to the Ministry of Finance, all taxable transactions for goods and services will be subject to a five percent (5%) tax. In addition, services and infrastructure provided by the public will be subject to taxation. Many people have had concerns about the VAT implementation since the day it went into effect. As a result, the Federal Tax Authority (FTA) has issued several clarifications and guidelines to clarify this VAT implementation's issues.</p>
                        <p>According to Federal Law No.2 of 2015 on Commercial Companies, tax-registered companies must abide by the following regulations:</p>
                        <ul class="Mtop-20">
                            <li>

                                <p>The accounting reports of every organization or company must be kept for five years.</p>
                            </li>

                                <strong>Article 348 of the Federal Law No.2 of 2015</strong>
                                <p>Failing to keep accounting records will result in a fine ranging from 50,000 to 500,000 AED.</p>
                            </li>

                                <strong>Article 349 of the Federal Law No.2 of 2015.</strong>
                                <p>If VAT filing records are not maintained for five years, a fine of up to 200,000 AED may be applied.</p>

                            <h3>Types of UAE VAT Registration </h3>

                            <p>
                                In the UAE, VAT registration can be done in two cases:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="list-style:decimal;">
                                <li>
                                    Mandatory registration
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Voluntary registration.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Mandatory registration</h3>
                            <p>
                                The UAE VAT is mandatory for business owners who reside in the state and have made supplies in the state with over AED 375,000 in the prior 12 months. Also, VAT is mandatory for non-resident selling taxable supplies/ providing taxable service in UAE regardless of their sale value. Similarly, the business should register if the business anticipates exceeding the mandatory registration threshold of AED 375,000 within 30 days. In such a case, it is also required to register for UAE VAT.  The UAE requires all businesses in the country to register under VAT, regardless of their residence.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Voluntary Registration:</h3>
                            <p>The VAT registration of companies with a place of residence in the UAE is voluntary if they are not required to register. In order to qualify for voluntary vat registration UAE, one must not have an annual purchase or taxable expense below the threshold. Voluntary vat registration threshold of AED 187,500 is equal to 50% of the mandatory registration threshold.</p>

                                    <strong>What is the difference between Sales Tax and VAT?</strong>
                                    <p>
                                        A sales tax is charged on the final sale to the consumer. Furthermore, VAT is imposed on goods and services throughout the supply chain, including at the point of sale.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <strong>What is the difference between exempt and zero-rated supply?</strong>
                                    <p>
                                        Zero-rated supplies are taxable supplies charged at 0% VAT, while exempt supplies are not taxable.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <strong>What is Value Added Tax (VAT) in UAE?</strong>
                                    <p>
                                        The value-added tax (VAT) is a transaction-based indirect tax in UAE that is applied at each stepping stone along the supply chain. Generally, the VAT cost is borne by the end consumer, whereas registered businesses collect and account for the tax on behalf of the Federal Tax Authority.
                                    </p>
