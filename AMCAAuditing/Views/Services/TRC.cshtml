                        <h2>What is a Tax Residency Certificate?</h2>
                        <p>Tax Domicile Certificate is a document demonstrating that you pay income taxes to a particular country and grants you the right to take advantage of double taxation avoidance agreements with that country.

In addition, companies that have been incorporated for over one year and are managed from the United Arab Emirates can also qualify for the Tax Residency Certificate, in which case we might also be of interest to you.   </p>
