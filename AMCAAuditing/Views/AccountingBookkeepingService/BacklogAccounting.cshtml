                        <p>Generally, a backlog refers to an order or document that needs to be completed. This is why backlog accounting is essential. In addition, it represents revenue that the company can earn but has not earned. This is because the company cannot handle the increase in orders or workload, which is outside of its capacity, or improper management can cause this problem. </p>
                        <p>The increase in backlog can be attributed to several factors, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Establishing a new sales region.</li>
                            <li>Growth in the investment of sales staff.</li>
                            <li>A reduction in product prices.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="Mtop-15">
                            <li>
                                <strong>Simple Audit Process</strong>
                                <p>As all the earlier details would be accessible to the auditor, updating backlog accounts will simplify it for them to audit the firm. It will also help the auditor compare the past information obtained by the business and draw a trend line for the organization.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Supports Decision Making</strong>
                                <p>Reports drawn from the accounts will assist the organization in making tactic decisions for the company's benefit. For example, with an immense cash balance, it can opt for investing in any project, or with a low cash balance, it can avail facilities to guarantee that the business runs smoothly.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Better Management of Cash Flow</strong>
                                <p>Updating backlog accounts will provide the management insights as to how the association managed to handle and advantage from the funds and studying from it so they could better manage the funds of the organization in the present scenario.</p>
                            </li>

                                <strong>Saves Time</strong>
                                <p>Suppose there is a failure in updating backlog accounts, which results in the financial statements of the organization being unavailable. In that case, the administration doesn't need to waste the valuable resources producing the data for the prior duration to be able to compare them with the most recent reports. Which could disrupt the entirety of the company’s critical production cycles?</p>

                                <strong>Data Retrieval Made Easy</strong>
                                <p>Suppose a certified accountant has been updating backlog accounts, and it's updated. In that case, it will become more convenient for the management of the business to sort out the earlier information in case they decide to chart a trend line or analyze the clients' preferences.</p>

                                <strong>Prevents Data Duplication</strong>
                                <p>Failure to update backlog accounts makes it feasible for small-scale industries to miss recording certain transactional information. At this point, the association might think it doesn't have to record the entry; however, it might require it later. Later, while updating backlog accounts, any duplicate entry is immediately eliminated.</p>
